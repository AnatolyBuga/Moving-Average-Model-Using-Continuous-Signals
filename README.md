# Moving average model using continuous signals 

## Notes
Highly efficient: uses [polars](https://pola-rs.github.io/polars/py-polars/html/reference/index.html) under the hood\
Highly configurable

## Assumptions and Future Steps
Currently supports only Act360 yearfrac\
Need to add grpahs

## Steps to run:
- Git checkout
- Set up virtual env: `python -m venv .venv`
- Activate venv
- Don't forget `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
- - If you prefer using notebook(note Jupyter is part of requirements.txt If you don't need it - remove it): `python -m notebook` and then navigate to `Driver.ipynb`
  - Alternatively run driver.py
